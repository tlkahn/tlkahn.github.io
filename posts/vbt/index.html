<p>This is the English translation after I finished my study in varanasi by end of &lsquo;19 (right before the pandemic). I think it is time to make this public. If you are interested to know more, there is a full annotation on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vijnana-Bhairava-Tantra-Word-Word-ebook/dp/B0869BJBTR?ref_=ast_author_mpb">Amazon</a>.</p>
<p>Without further ado, here is the full text:</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Sri Devi asked:</p>
<p>I heard that everything is illusion.</p>
<p>We should follow the instruction of Rudrayāmala to enter union.</p>
<p>Trika as a totality is not separable.</p>
<p>Best of the best guidance, please explain part by part.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Today many questions are left unﬁnished</p>
<p>And doubted, highest creator.</p>
<p>What is real rūpa, deva?</p>
<p>What is sound-quantity (śabdarāśirna), manifested images (kalā), and illusions</p>
<p>(maya)?</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>What are nine mantras (navātma) for non-duality,</p>
<p>To complete the realization of bhairava?</p>
<p>Since making such wishes, breaking and splitting are already going,</p>
<p>What is śakti and its three-fold composition?</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>[What are] Nāda, bindu and māya,</p>
<p>What is half moon (candra-ārdha), what is non-arising (nirodhikāḥ)?</p>
<p>How does the mind arise from cakras?</p>
<p>What is the true nature of śakti?</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Transcedentally transcend the parts,</p>
<p>Destroy dependent subjects,</p>
<p>Transcend what is in that manner,</p>
<p>Transcended, thus ascended.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Neither every countenance is breakable,</p>
<p>Nor the body is, by becoming.</p>
<p>Transcended, diminished,</p>
<p>Parts will not lead to becoming.</p>
<p>7a</p>
<p>My kind lord, please do condescend,</p>
<p>Dispelling my doubts completely.</p>
<p>7b-8a</p>
<p>Great, great what you asked,</p>
<p>Best tantra I now speak in a soft tone to you, my love.</p>
<p>On many hiding secrets of śiva,</p>
<p>I am telling you this way.</p>
<p>8b-9a</p>
<p>What is the part of cit? Forms (Rūpa).</p>
<p>So is self-nature (ātma), as part of bhairava.</p>
<p>The essence of my teachings is also in this manner,</p>
<p>The recognition (vijñana) is like the indra&rsquo;s net (indrajala).</p>
<p>9b</p>
<p>Maya is like a dream of the highest cit,</p>
<p>or like gandharva&rsquo;s city in the sky. All ignorance.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>The purpose of meditation is all about awakening.</p>
<p>Actions (kriya) is vanity for a living.</p>
<p>For a man, the only represented knowledge to get united spiritually,</p>
<p>is seated in vikalpa.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>In reality, bhairava is not nine forms of mantras.</p>
<p>Nor sound-quantity (śabdarāśirna).</p>
<p>Nor that of trika.</p>
<p>Nor that of three-fold śakti.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Nor sounds, bindu or maya,</p>
<p>Nor half-moon (candrārdha), nor non-arising (nirodhikāḥ),</p>
<p>Nor mixed chakra-practice (cakrakrama),</p>
<p>Nor śakti nor true nature (ātma).</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>Above are for immature minds,</p>
<p>Terrifying the mentally weak ones.</p>
<p>All like mother giving pleasing caddies,</p>
<p>Only appearing and serving for calling and illustration.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>The space and time, both manifested images bringing no liberation.</p>
<p>The sense of organs illuminate the body but are no body.</p>
<p>The idea of one who shows and names is impossible and intoxicating.</p>
<p>The highest truth goes on and on but unspeakable.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>The essence of self-being (svabhava) is internal joy (ānandā).</p>
<p>vikalpa is the power to be free.</p>
<p>So far that what resides are full of manifested images (kārā),</p>
<p>bhairava is the supreme mind .</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>Thus, cognize the real body.</p>
<p>See the universe of nothing but purity.</p>
<p>The manner of true transcendence happens,</p>
<p>Is the way of [real] ceremony (pūja) or pleasing God.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>The form of bhairava unrolls,</p>
<p>When you reside everywhere [and nowhere].</p>
<p>With the transcendental transcending form (rūpa),</p>
<p>The transcendental self-nature is.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>In that manner of powerful śakti,</p>
<p>Indivisible, residing everywhere,</p>
<p>Hence the laws(dharma) become laws-in-the-go(dharmavāt),</p>
<p>When śakti goes transcendental, mind goes transcendental.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>Different those, [cognize] the dis-manifest (vibhāvyate).</p>
<p>Perfect cognition on entities,</p>
<p>Beginning to enter [the supreme state].</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>Remain being within śakti,</p>
<p>[Keep on] creative contemplation on undivided (abheda),</p>
<p>That is śiva&rsquo;s form,</p>
<p>That is the proper entrance from this world to śiva.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>The world in that manner is as suggested.</p>
<p>Like splendid shining beams of light.</p>
<p>Cognition arises as freedom of existence (vibhāgādi).</p>
<p>Thus, śakti goes and śiva is realized.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>My trident-marked lord,</p>
<p>Skull-decorations-worn one,</p>
<p>Space, time, and emptiness show themselves,</p>
<p>everywhere and nowhere.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>Residing full of manifested images (kārā),</p>
<p>How to become bhairava and understand directly?</p>
<p>Whose path and entrance [to follow]?</p>
<p>How to transcend myself and become [bhairava, the one], I would like to know.</p>
<p>On what right I&rsquo;ness can I realize,</p>
<p>Being as is and developing bhairava?</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>Upward is prāna,</p>
<p>Downward is jīvo,</p>
<p>Pause (visarga) is ātmā,</p>
<p>Transcendence is uccāra.</p>
<p>[Where] the two-fold respiration is born,</p>
<p>[One ﬁnd there] full of nourishments and pacifying.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>Breath in, breath out.</p>
<p>Where life meets ether.</p>
<p>In this way, bhairava in the move becomes bhairava.</p>
<p>And body etherized.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>Neither let śakti wonder or enter into it,</p>
<p>Let the form of breaths manifest,</p>
<p>Through which, nirvikalpa is in the middle, and</p>
<p>The form of Bhairava exists everywhere.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>Clear the retained breath (kumbhitā),</p>
<p>Breath in there, [when] one becomes [the one].</p>
<p>Thus one&rsquo;s inside archives peace and so is one&rsquo;s consciousness.</p>
<p>When śakti achieves peace, bhairava manifests.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>From root (mūla), rays of light illuminates.</p>
<p>Subtler, subtler, rising upward.</p>
<p>In this way, consider love and loathing,</p>
<p>the same inside. Bhairava arises.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>The intention (iccha) rise inside in the form of lightnings.</p>
<p>In the sequence of cakras [successively].</p>
<p>As far as three-ﬁstful upward,</p>
<p>Your inside [sees] the great arising.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>In the proper sequence of [going through] the internal-twelfth-ﬁnger [dvādaśanta],</p>
<p>The twelfth-ﬁnger (dvādaśa) melts away, undivided.</p>
<p>Gross, subtle, transcendental,</p>
<p>Freedom, freedom, inside becomes śiva.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>Like that, breath in, breath out. [Feel] inside of your head crown.</p>
<p>With the contraction of eyebrows, break [the crown].</p>
<p>After mind obtains nirvikalpa,</p>
<p>Everything goes upward. Everything ascends.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>Like peacock&rsquo;s crest [seen from] side, showing variegated colors,</p>
<p>Five-fold emptiness(śūnya) like a maṇḍala.</p>
<p>Meditate on such emptiness(śūnya) in one&rsquo;s hollow inside,</p>
<p>By entering one&rsquo;s heart (hṛdaya), one becomes (bhairava).</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>Like such, follow the chakra sequence (krama),</p>
<p>Contemplate that therein,</p>
<p>Emptiness (śūnya), non-oneness (divisions, kuḍya), oneness (transcendental savior, parepātre)</p>
<p>Dissolved in one&rsquo;s self. Wish granted.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>Place the mind inside the skull.</p>
<p>Reside with eyes half-open.</p>
<p>During the sequence (krama), keep the mind ﬁrm.</p>
<p>Highest goal will be achieved.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>Dwell in the middle of the middle nāḍī,</p>
<p>[Where] the string of soul [is like] a ﬁbrous lotus stalk.</p>
<p>Meditate upon its inside space.</p>
<p>There God manifests.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>See in one&rsquo;s mental eyes that manifested images (kārā) are mere obstructions.</p>
<p>The contraction of eyebrows (bhrūbhedā) is the entrance to arising.</p>
<p>View bindu dissolved in sequence.</p>
<p>In the middle of everywhere, the highest stands.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>The internal law (dhāma) jolts and ascends,</p>
<p>Ended with subtle ﬂames known as tilakā.</p>
<p>The light of bindu is from inside of heart (hṛdaya).</p>
<p>Meditate on that dissolved in [one&rsquo;s heart]. [One becomes] dissolved [into the</p>
<p>one] .</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>Unsurpassed savior is in one&rsquo;s ears.</p>
<p>Sounds can lead to dissolution quickly.</p>
<p>Perfect brahman sounds bring full accomplishments.</p>
<p>Supreme brahman walks above.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>During utterance of śabda, praṇa ascending and traversing.</p>
<p>With [sounds] extended, waned, and echoed, perform creative contemplate (bhāvanā) on their inside emptiness.</p>
<p>The emptiness transcends in the same manner as śakti.</p>
<p>The emptiness is to be feared.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>No endeavor on syllables.</p>
<p>Adhere to the end of the last word, then become [the one].</p>
<p>Emptier, emptier, become the emptiness, like that.</p>
<p>Realizing men as manifested images (kārā) of emptiness, [one] becomes [the</p>
<p>one].</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>Music sounds of string instruments are śabda-arrows.</p>
<p>Far reaching and [strong] arrows. Residing together with sequence (krama).</p>
<p>The target is the inside, no-difference mind (citta).</p>
<p>Realizing body [the same as] the transcendental ether, one becomes [the one].</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>Everything is vowel-less mantra (piṇḍamantra).</p>
<p>[From] the gross syllables, the sequence [begins].</p>
<p>Half-moon (ardhendu), bindu, nāda, all internal.</p>
<p>While becoming the uttered emptiness (śūnya), one becomes [the one].</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>One&rsquo;s own body, where all directions are,</p>
<p>At the same time (yugapad) all vanishes into ether.</p>
<p>[As such], nirvikalpa mind begins,</p>
<p>[When one simultaneously] engages in the void all around.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>Above is emptiness. Below (mūla) is emptiness.</p>
<p>Simultaneously (yugapad), both become this way.</p>
<p>Be indifferent and ignore one&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>Mind on śakti and śūnya. One becomes [the one].</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>Above is emptiness. Below is emptiness.</p>
<p>Stay there when one&rsquo;s heart becomes emptiness.</p>
<p>At the same time, [keep in] the nirvikalpa state.</p>
<p>Nirvikalpa arises. Let it be.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>[Feel] emptiness of limbs and rest of body,</p>
<p>In milliseconds (kṣaṇa-mātra), one becomes free from existence.</p>
<p>Become nirvikalpa, be nirvikalpa.</p>
<p>[Realize that] nirvikalpa as one&rsquo;s true nature.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>Everywhere, the nature, the whole creation,</p>
<p>Ether is omnipresent.</p>
<p>Freedom from existence and arising begins.</p>
<p>Contemplate residing with this. One becomes [the one].</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>The division of inside [and outside] the body,</p>
<p>Consider them becoming like walls.</p>
<p>Nothing inside begins.</p>
<p>Meditate on having nothing inside. One becomes [the one].</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>In one&rsquo;s heart-ether, dissolve senses from organs.</p>
<p>In the middle of the lotus seat,</p>
<p>Non-difference thought (citta) is shining.</p>
<p>Highest beauty is obtained.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>All across self-body,</p>
<p>Thoughts are dissolved in the internal-twelfth-ﬁngers (dvādaśānte).</p>
<p>Firm awareness becomes ﬁrm.</p>
<p>The real goal is thus engaged.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>Thus, in that manner, over there,</p>
<p>The internal-twelfth-ﬁngers(dvādaśānte), cast your mind.</p>
<p>Every moment, [be aware that] being in a diminishing manner.</p>
<p>Causeless and goal-less, one becomes [the one] one day and one night.</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>Fire of time, light of time,</p>
<p>Arises and ﬁlls ones&rsquo;s own body.</p>
<p>Contemplate on the inside burning,</p>
<p>And the peaceful lights. Then, one becomes [the one].</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>Going and going, the whole world,</p>
<p>Meditate on vikalpa burning and burnt.</p>
<p>[Become] one of no difference thoughts.</p>
<p>[Become] one of highest being. One becomes [the one].</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>Self-body, the world, as goes.</p>
<p>Subtler, subtler, [eventally] pervades.</p>
<p>Residence of the real driver of breaths [are realized].</p>
<p>[When one] meditates on the transcendental internal ether.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p>While thick śakti turns thin,</p>
<p>Meditate within the scope of twelfth-ﬁngers (dvādaśa).</p>
<p>Entering into heart-chakra (hṛdaya), keep meditating.</p>
<p>Unbinding from the [worldly] dream is obtained.</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>The main form of worldly path,</p>
<p>is considering sequences (krama) with vacuity.</p>
<p>Gross, subtle and transcendental, reside.</p>
<p>The whole inside mind is dissolved.</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>Sitting with the whole universe, everywhere,</p>
<p>The ubiquitous master inside, is the same with śiva.</p>
<p>The real way for ceremonies and devotion,</p>
<p>Of śiva is to meditate on the great arising.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>Now the universe,</p>
<p>Consider as being emptiness (śūnya).</p>
<p>There [as] such, mind dissolves.</p>
<p>There, total dissolution is possessed.</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>See with mental eye that suspension of breath is possessed.</p>
<p>All divisions abandoned, removed, cast.</p>
<p>Total dissolution arise. One obtain [the one-ness] within a millisecond.</p>
<p>Totally dissolved, wholly absorbed. One becomes [the one].</p>
<p>60</p>
<p>No trees, hills, walls.</p>
<p>View places [as] removed and cast.</p>
<p>Become mentally dissolved.</p>
<p>[Allow] subtle-styled to appear.</p>
<p>61</p>
<p>In both ways [of contrasting dual], ﬁnd cognition (jñana),</p>
<p>By Meditating on the middle. Seek shelter there.</p>
<p>Simultaneously (yogapad), one shall abandon the dual.</p>
<p>There in the middle, truth shines.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p>Become abandoned and non-departed cit.</p>
<p>Avoid becoming an inside wonderer.</p>
<p>Thus, [one] becomes the extended middle.</p>
<p>Greater world is manifesting.</p>
<p>63</p>
<p>The whole body is consisting of only pure intelligence.</p>
<p>Become transcendental of this two-folded world.</p>
<p>At the same time, nirvikalpa [arises].</p>
<p>Mind [is transcended and ] arises to the highest.</p>
<p>64</p>
<p>[Be aware of where] two-fold breaths join.</p>
<p>Inside enters. Outside exits.</p>
<p>Yogi [shall have such] sameness recognition (vijñana).</p>
<p>Arising mind is possessed.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p>[Meditate on that] the entire world and one&rsquo;s own body goes on,</p>
<p>Full of self-dependent joy. [One] becomes love.</p>
<p>At the same time, one&rsquo;s self [becomes] death-less.</p>
<p>Transcend [even this] joy as illusion, one becomes [the one].</p>
<p>66</p>
<p>Vain religious austerities and dramatic ritual performance,</p>
<p>Will perish and be gone.</p>
<p>Rise with the great joy,</p>
<p>Whereby the truth manifests.</p>
<p>67</p>
<p>All organs of senses are bondage.</p>
<p>Move prāna and śakti upward slowly.</p>
<p>At the right moment, [one] feels ants crawling,</p>
<p>which manifests the highest delight.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>Now, [burn one&rsquo;s] intellect [as] sacriﬁce in rites, in the middle.</p>
<p>Thoughts are comforting illusion. Cast away.</p>
<p>Proceeding, only ﬁlled with breaths.</p>
<p>Unit [with] love and joy.</p>
<p>69</p>
<p>Get united with śakti, [feel energy running] trembling and agitated.</p>
<p>Completely be absorbed and reside in śakti.</p>
<p>Since comfort is the true creator (brahma),</p>
<p>It brings forth one&rsquo;s own ascension.</p>
<p>70</p>
<p>Taste the agitation and smoothing.</p>
<p>Recollect the spreading comfort in full measure.</p>
<p>Become śakti this way.</p>
<p>Become the inundated joy.</p>
<p>71</p>
<p>The great joy is attained,</p>
<p>[When] seeing or envisioning a family or friend missing for a long time.</p>
<p>Meditate on such joy arising.</p>
<p>All minds get wholly absorbed. One becomes [the one].</p>
<p>72</p>
<p>Eating, drinking, [be aware of] joy in such actions.</p>
<p>The joy of taste is blossoming.</p>
<p>Become ﬁlled and reside [with].</p>
<p>The great joy. One becomes [the one].</p>
<p>73</p>
<p>Self-apply songs and hearings.</p>
<p>[Of the] same pleasure, mind&rsquo;s agent of action [is].</p>
<p>Yogis, wholly absorbed as such.</p>
<p>[From] minds thus produces ātma.</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>There, there, the delight of the no-difference mind.</p>
<p>The mind possessed in that very place,</p>
<p>Thus, thus the transcendental joy,</p>
<p>The true nature, engaged wholly.</p>
<p>75</p>
<p>When sleep [is approaching yet] to arrive,</p>
<p>The sphere of outside vanished.</p>
<p>[Where] the self-abiding consciousness [becomes] accessible,</p>
<p>Transcendence manifests.</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>Light is the lamp of emptiness,</p>
<p>Gleaming variegated appearances in ether.</p>
<p>View those non-rendered (dṛṣṭi nirveśya). Right there,</p>
<p>True self-nature manifests.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>Manifested images (kārā) is what is born there.</p>
<p>Omnipresent bhairava, is no different from a snake.</p>
<p>In khecarā&rsquo;s way, view a small part of anything (kalā)</p>
<p>One obtained transcendence and [the one] manifests.</p>
<p>78</p>
<p>[Adopt] the corpse pose (mṛdvāsana, savasana). Like oars,</p>
<p>[Leave] arms and legs, [with] no support.</p>
<p>Fix on that union.</p>
<p>Contemplate on the ﬁlled transcendence. One becomes [the one].</p>
<p>79</p>
<p>In a proper sitting pose,</p>
<p>Rest one&rsquo;s arms crooked like a cup.</p>
<p>Think of ether in the armpits.</p>
<p>Feel extended equanimity. Fully dissolved.</p>
<p>80</p>
<p>A gross form object,</p>
<p>Firmly ﬁx one&rsquo;s view [in mental eyes] settled on it,</p>
<p>Soon, one will enter support-less being (nirādhāra),</p>
<p>Mind thus goes with the one.</p>
<p>81</p>
<p>Tongue in the middle with [uvula] widely open,</p>
<p>Thoughts cast down in the middle.</p>
<p>Utter &lsquo;ha&rsquo; in the mind [with exhale],</p>
<p>Let it be and peace dawns.</p>
<p>82</p>
<p>Sitting, sleeping, standing,</p>
<p>[Be in] support-less state (nirādhāra), free from existence.</p>
<p>Self-body, mind goes subtle.</p>
<p>In a millisecond, mental disposition (āśaya) goes thin. One becomes [the one].</p>
<p>83</p>
<p>Standing and sitting in a moving position,</p>
<p>Which proceeds and presents a moving body.</p>
<p>Mind discontinues this way. One becomes [the one].</p>
<p>Śiva will be obtained.</p>
<p>84</p>
<p>Alas, watch the spotless ether.</p>
<p>View the non-inside.</p>
<p>The most ﬁrm true nature. Thus, within a millisecond,</p>
<p>The body of the one is obtained.</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>[Meditate on] one&rsquo;s forehead fully dissolved into the whole ether,</p>
<p>Until one feels as [the one].</p>
<p>The entire manifested images (kārā) of bhairava,</p>
<p>Thoroughly enter into their true quintessence.</p>
<p>86</p>
<p>Limited knowledge (jñāta) causes duality.</p>
<p>Outside worlds [are what] śiva destroys.</p>
<p>The universal primary form of the one,</p>
<p>The absolute eternal inﬁnite cognition is shining and possessed.</p>
<p>87</p>
<p>Proceed, on a pitch dark deep night,</p>
<p>On the ﬁrst of a fornight, [without moon]. Dwell for a long time,</p>
<p>Unable to see the form of beings is eyes&rsquo; problem.</p>
<p>The one [only shows when] desire for forms stopped.</p>
<p>88</p>
<p>Proceed. Shut eyes ﬁrst.</p>
<p>Ahead, deep dark ether ahead.</p>
<p>Going forward, [see] bhairava&rsquo;s form.</p>
<p>Wholly absorbed in this existence. One becomes [the one].</p>
<p>89</p>
<p>Endeavors are harmful for [spiritual] faculties.</p>
<p>Subdue [the motive to make efforts] in this way. Non-arising (nirodha).</p>
<p>Enter the non-dual emptiness.</p>
<p>Right there, one&rsquo;s nature (ātmā) manifests.</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>No bindu, no visarga,</p>
<p>No kāra. [Only] the sound, the great sound,</p>
<p>Rises with force.</p>
<p>Cognize in entirety the highest God.</p>
<p>91</p>
<p>Words are with visarga.</p>
<p>Thoughts (cit) goes with inside visarga.</p>
<p>Make thoughts support-less (nirādhāra).</p>
<p>Feel the eternal brahma.</p>
<p>92</p>
<p>Self-nature (ātmā) is manifested images (kāra) of ether.</p>
<p>Meditation is the compass guiding to freedom.</p>
<p>Become independent and basis-less (nirāśrayā), the consciousness (cit) and śakti.</p>
<p>Self-form (svarūpa) thus shows up.</p>
<p>93</p>
<p>[When] a part of limb is wounded,</p>
<p>[Such] strong [painful] arising feelings contain mighty information.</p>
<p>Right there, one&rsquo;s consciousness gains union [with the one],</p>
<p>[Where] spotless bhairava is seated.</p>
<p>94</p>
<p>Remove the limitedness of one&rsquo;s consciousness (citta).</p>
<p>Self (mamān) existence [becomes]:</p>
<p>Vikalpa on living-beings and non-existence.</p>
<p>[Then even] abandon vikalpa. One becomes [the one].</p>
<p>95</p>
<p>Illusions (māyā) are beguiling indeed.</p>
<p>Keep expanding (kalāyā) and let thoughts stop.</p>
<p>The ﬁrst law (dharma) of true living beings is,</p>
<p>Expanding one&rsquo;s individuality. One becomes [the one].</p>
<p>96</p>
<p>Once the intention (icchā) is born,</p>
<p>[Immediately] behold with apathy. This is the right manner.</p>
<p>Where (iccā) is born,</p>
<p>Right there clinging and attachment begins [and union is lost].</p>
<p>97</p>
<p>If one&rsquo;s own intention (iccā) is not born,</p>
<p>Cognition begins. Bad I&rsquo;ness is exhausted.</p>
<p>Real self, truth existence,</p>
<p>Be fully absorbed in [which] with the whole mind. One becomes [the one].</p>
<p>98</p>
<p>Intention, or rather cognition,</p>
<p>gives rise to entrance to cit.</p>
<p>Attain enlightenment of nature (ātmā) with no-difference mind ascending.</p>
<p>The true meaning shows.</p>
<p>99</p>
<p>Causeless, existential cognition [shows that]</p>
<p>Ātmā is support-less and erroneous.</p>
<p>True light of cit arrived.</p>
<p>Keep on, the one becomes (śivaḥ) [the one].</p>
<p>100</p>
<p>The law of universal consciousness (cit) is [inherently embodied] in everything.</p>
<p>Rather than being shot in like an arrow, wherever consciousness exists.</p>
<p>[When individual] soul becomes one with everything,</p>
<p>One is capable of existential cognition (bhavajijñana).</p>
<p>101</p>
<p>Lust, hatred, greed, confusion,</p>
<p>Madness, malice, etc.,</p>
<p>Freedom from which, one shall be enlightened through,</p>
<p>What remains and is real.</p>
<p>102</p>
<p>Universe is an illusion, like indra&rsquo;s net.</p>
<p>Cast down like a powerful magic.</p>
<p>Meditate on everything, roaming around.</p>
<p>Behold! Happiness dawns!</p>
<p>103</p>
<p>No mentalities. Abandon pains.</p>
<p>No euphoria. All [contrasting feelings] one shall abandon.</p>
<p>Direct cognition is obtained in the middle,</p>
<p>Where truth remains.</p>
<p>104</p>
<p>Abandon attachment to one&rsquo;s own body.</p>
<p>Expand everywhere into every being,</p>
<p>With the entire heart ﬁrmly [seated]. View [in mental eyes]</p>
<p>That joy of no difference. One becomes [the one].</p>
<p>105</p>
<p>Firstly, suspend the breaths [as in ﬁre rituals], rather than recognize (vijñāna).</p>
<p>The ﬁrst intention (icchā) is not from one&rsquo;s own inside.</p>
<p>It is existent in everything and everywhere, diffused and omnipresent.</p>
<p>[Then one shall realize that] one being has everything.</p>
<p>106</p>
<p>Understand beings as recipients of saṁvit (universal consciousness),</p>
<p>Of which, Every living being shared in common.</p>
<p>Yogi shall enter that,</p>
<p>universal bonding(saṁbandha) [with] attentiveness.</p>
<p>107</p>
<p>What one has is not the body, [which is]</p>
<p>The physical metaphor (anubhāva) of the universal consciousness (saṁvit).</p>
<p>Contemplate one&rsquo;s self-body,</p>
<p>as abandoned and [reside in] omnipresence. One becomes [the one] one day and</p>
<p>one night.</p>
<p>108</p>
<p>With the support-less (nirādhāra) mind,</p>
<p>Always no-difference, be no difference,</p>
<p>As the nature, highest nature.</p>
<p>One becomes [the one].</p>
<p>109</p>
<p>The cognition of entirety (sarvajña) is no difference from identity (sarvakartā)</p>
<p>with entirety.</p>
<p>With the pervading highest creator.</p>
<p>With self [realized] such God&rsquo;s law (śaivadharmā),</p>
<p>Firmly, one becomes [the one].</p>
<p>110</p>
<p>[Like] illusions relates to maya (ur-maya).</p>
<p>Flames are a shattered part of ﬁre. Rays of sunlight.</p>
<p>Me [is] also as such, of bhairava.</p>
<p>Me is a shattered division of the universe.</p>
<p>111</p>
<p>Whirl and whirl, the body</p>
<p>Hastes, then falls to the ground.</p>
<p>The excitement of śakti waned and ceased.</p>
<p>The transcendental great victory state [manifests].</p>
<p>112</p>
<p>Support can be an instructor, or rather, śakti.</p>
<p>Cognize, thoughts dissolved.</p>
<p>Śakti is aroused [when one is] entering,</p>
<p>the inside excitement. [Śakti as] the body of bhairava.</p>
<p>113</p>
<p>Teachings of this tradition.</p>
<p>Listen, here [is the] proper talk.</p>
<p>Final emancipation, newly-born, śiva&rsquo;s way,</p>
<p>Eyes ﬁrm ﬁxed in the whole.</p>
<p>114</p>
<p>Contract your hearing.</p>
<p>For apertures in lower body, [contract] in the same manner.</p>
<p>Meditate on the vowel-less consonant-less (anackam-ahalaṁ) [sounds],</p>
<p>Supreme eternal brahma.</p>
<p>115</p>
<p>In the direction of a well or, a great cave,</p>
<p>Stand over without seeing,</p>
<p>The proper no-difference mind.</p>
<p>At the same moment, thoughts get dissolved. [The one] manifests.</p>
<p>116</p>
<p>There, there, mind stops.</p>
<p>Outside goes inside.</p>
<p>Thus, thus, the one stays.</p>
<p>Here is everywhere.</p>
<p>117</p>
<p>There, there, all organs of senses are paths,</p>
<p>[Through which], the form-less universal consciousness (cit) becomes visible.</p>
<p>His entirety is bestowed with attributes of Logos (vāc).</p>
<p>Pervading and lurking cit is full of nature-ness (form identity, ātmātā).</p>
<p>118</p>
<p>At the beginning and the end of (ādyante): sneezes, fear, grief,</p>
<p>Confusions in mind, battleﬁeld escape,</p>
<p>Interests in any extraordinary matters, hunger,</p>
<p>Are all close to brahma&rsquo;s existence.</p>
<p>119</p>
<p>Direct one&rsquo;s mind towards recollections of some reality.</p>
<p>View the place with mind abandoned.</p>
<p>[Allow] the whole body become support-less (nirādhāra).</p>
<p>Keep proceeding. [The one] becomes visible.</p>
<p>120</p>
<p>Anywhere, a placed object,</p>
<p>View [it] as nulliﬁed, gradually.</p>
<p>That jñana is associated with thoughts.</p>
<p>Get dissolved in emptiness (śūnya). One becomes [the one].</p>
<p>121</p>
<p>Devotion is so abundant that [one becomes] indifferent from passion and worldly attachment.</p>
<p>As achieving success through intellect,</p>
<p>[Proceed] with śakti, the eternal ﬁre.</p>
<p>Become great. [One] ascend and becomes one with Śiva.</p>
<p>122</p>
<p>Dwell on objects or subjects out of thought focus.</p>
<p>Gradually [realize] the emptiness of reality [there].</p>
<p>Meditate with all heart, towards greatness.</p>
<p>With that mastered, peace [dawns].</p>
<p>123</p>
<p>Short-witted minds are attached to purity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With purity, Śiva manifests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[Actually] there is neither purity nor impurity in I&rsquo;ness.</p>
<p>Be with nirvikalpa and happiness. One becomes [the one].</p>
<p>124</p>
<p>All beings have the nature of bhairava,</p>
<p>Sharing the same scope as God-ness or divinity goes.</p>
<p>Therefore, [there is] no distinction.</p>
<p>Reside in transcendence, Rest on the non-dualism.</p>
<p>125</p>
<p>[Regard] friends the same as foes,</p>
<p>Human beings the same as ideas.</p>
<p>The transcendental brahma consciousness is ﬁlled with Logos (vāc).</p>
<p>Have this, the blissful cognition. One becomes [the one].</p>
<p>126</p>
<p>No enmities, wherever.</p>
<p>No affections, there.</p>
<p>Destroy [distinction of] affections and enmities. One is free.</p>
<p>Brahma proceeds in the middle way.</p>
<p>127</p>
<p>What is not known. What is not understandable.</p>
<p>What is emptiness (śūnya). What is non-existence.</p>
<p>In this manner [realize] bhairava beings everywhere.</p>
<p>In this manner, one [becomes] enlightened omnipresent being ﬁnally.</p>
<p>128</p>
<p>The eternal basis-free (nirāśraya) emptiness (śūnya),</p>
<p>Pervades when understanding is abandoned.</p>
<p>With thoughts goes beyond ether,</p>
<p>[One realizes that there is] no ether and enters thoroughly [into the one].</p>
<p>129</p>
<p>There, there, [wherever] mind goes,</p>
<p>That, that, in that very moment,</p>
<p>Abandon [it] as unstable and ﬁckle,</p>
<p>Thus, calm [dawns as the sea without waves]. One becomes [the one].</p>
<p>130</p>
<p>Fearful bellows everywhere,</p>
<p>Pervading, indivisible and vacant.</p>
<p>In this way, [realize] bhairava&rsquo;s sound,</p>
<p>Continuous, uninterrupted. One becomes [the one with śiva].</p>
<p>131</p>
<p>In my I&rsquo;ness, wherever at the beginning of [such thought]: &ldquo;here I am&rdquo;,</p>
<p>In the direction of getting attached [mentally],</p>
<p>[Let] mind become support-less (nirādhāra),</p>
<p>Meditate purely directing this.</p>
<p>132</p>
<p>Eternal, omnipresent, support-less,</p>
<p>Pervading, complete, [leave] minds there,</p>
<p>Meditate disregarding their pronunciations.</p>
<p>Do this and substance goes in place of forms.</p>
<p>133</p>
<p>Untrue as lights from indra&rsquo;s net (indrajālā),</p>
<p>The concept of [&ldquo;here I am&rdquo;] is. [One shall] be existent everywhere.</p>
<p>What is truth, indra&rsquo;s net (itself).</p>
<p>Fix on this ﬁrmly. [One becomes] pure and translucent as the diamond.</p>
<p>134</p>
<p>Nature (ātma) is without manifested images (kāra).</p>
<p>Where there is cognition (jñāna), there is action (kriyā).</p>
<p>Cognition exerts itself on non-external beings.</p>
<p>Emptiness comes when I&rsquo;ness - &ldquo;Here I am (idaṁ)&rdquo;, becomes &ldquo;world-ness - world</p>
<p>I am (jaga)&rdquo;.</p>
<p>135</p>
<p>No bondage, no freedom,</p>
<p>In this way, hope of living is a scarecrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here I am&rdquo; is a picture on the limited intellect (buddi).</p>
<p>Arrows of illusions gleam like the sun.</p>
<p>136</p>
<p>Senses (indriya) are gates [to salvation] everywhere.</p>
<p>Joy, pains, when they begin to join.</p>
<p>Thus abandon senses (indriya) like [dismantling a cart by removing] pin of axles,</p>
<p>Self-abide (svastha). Self-nature(svātma) is [thus] nulliﬁed(nivartate).</p>
<p>137</p>
<p>In worldly [erroneous] language, cognition irradiates and illuminates, [and]</p>
<p>Nature (ātmā) is manifestation of God.</p>
<p>No-difference, indivisibility, non-existence,</p>
<p>Cognitive cognition dis-manifests (vibhāvyate).</p>
<p>138</p>
<p>Mind (mānasa), consciousness (cetanā), energy (śakti),</p>
<p>Self-nature (ātmā), all these four,</p>
<p>Whenever from which one is emancipated,</p>
<p>Then [one will become] bhairava&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>139</p>
<p>Teaching being waveless and calm,</p>
<p>One hundred told succinctly,</p>
<p>And twelve more,</p>
<p>[On] cognition and perceiving the one.</p>
<p>140</p>
<p>Here [if one learned even] one of those union,</p>
<p>[One can achieve] successfully, [and becomes] bhairava on one&rsquo;s own.</p>
<p>To speak holy words, to perform karmic acts,</p>
<p>To curse and to bless, one becomes an agent of deeds.</p>
<p>141</p>
<p>[One becomes] exempt from decay and death, being raw,</p>
<p>Unbounded, bestowed with all great qualities,</p>
<p>Yogi in union, a mighty master,</p>
<p>With one&rsquo;s spirit (dhi&rsquo;pa) united [with the pervading one].</p>
<p>142a</p>
<p>Even without the worldly life, the liberated one,</p>
<p>is, with neither actions nor attachments.</p>
<p>142b</p>
<p>Independent existence is the great iśvara.</p>
<p>143a</p>
<p>Freedoms arrives, [when one shall] pervade everywhere.</p>
<p>[What] chanting (japa) [shall one follow]?</p>
<p>143b</p>
<p>Meditate on no great ruler,</p>
<p>Neither ceremonies nor pleasing [gods].</p>
<p>144</p>
<p>To who are the ceremonies and burnings made?</p>
<p>Who takes the sacriﬁces? I would like to know.</p>
<p>Making wishes in that manner is external,</p>
<p>Like a gross spiritual teacher.</p>
<p>145</p>
<p>Expand state of existence. Transcend one&rsquo;s own being.</p>
<p>Creative contemplate on manifestation of emptiness (ābhāvyate).</p>
<p>Japa, in this respect, is one&rsquo;s own sound (nāda).</p>
<p>Mantra is sound of one&rsquo; nature (ātmā), as such.</p>
<p>146</p>
<p>Meditate with ﬁrm understanding [that]</p>
<p>No manifested images (nirākārā), no basis (nirāśrayā),</p>
<p>Nor meditate with a possessed body,</p>
<p>No face, no hand, or other imaginations.</p>
<p>147</p>
<p>Indeed, ceremonies (pūjā), [is] not about giving ﬂowers.</p>
<p>One who meditate and practice ﬁrmly,</p>
<p>be with nirvikalpa and transcend beyond ether,</p>
<p>[is] under ceremony by dissolving supports.</p>
<p>148</p>
<p>[Even achieve] one single union [of above] there,</p>
<p>One will rise and be gone one day and one night.</p>
<p>Full of kārā-less-ness, in this respect,</p>
<p>[One is performing] perfect completion god pleasing (tṛipti).</p>
<p>149</p>
<p>In the great abode of emptiness, burn as in ﬁre ritual,</p>
<p>Elements (bhūta), sense streams, sense organs, and so on,</p>
<p>Together with thinking, sacriﬁce all</p>
<p>As oblations, with consciousness as ladle.</p>
<p>150a</p>
<p>Yoga, followed in the way of the highest lord [is],</p>
<p>To achieve the goal of non-difference bliss,</p>
<p>To remove all the sins and impurities,</p>
<p>To protect the completeness.</p>
<p>151</p>
<p>Rudra&rsquo;s tradition on śakti is about the divine existential union.</p>
<p>The [true] pilgrimage is transcendental creative contemplation.</p>
<p>Different [from conventional wisdom], His truth [is],</p>
<p>Either ceremonies (pūjā) or pleasing gods (tṛpti).</p>
<p>152</p>
<p>Freedom (svatantra), bliss (ānanda), pure consciousness (cinmātra),</p>
<p>The essence of self-nature (svātmā) is everywhere.</p>
<p>Be in divine union, binding the self-form (svarūpa)</p>
<p>with one&rsquo;s own mind. [This is the true] puriﬁcation ablution to be done.</p>
<p>153</p>
<p>Ceremonies (pūja) is held on the whole existing creations.</p>
<p>Divine pleasing (tarpana) shall go beyond transcendence.</p>
<p>Śiva&rsquo;s pūja is everywhere.</p>
<p>With all such, where are the ceremonies?</p>
<p>154</p>
<p>Roaming prāna, entering jīva.</p>
<p>Intention, [meditating on those] are [all] crook actions.</p>
<p>The dwelled abode of self-nature (ātmā) is,</p>
<p>The destination of the transcendental pilgrimage. Transcendental transcendence.</p>
<p>155</p>
<p>Mouths and words are servants.</p>
<p>Stay with the great bliss (mahānanda). Ceremonies are illusions (maya).</p>
<p>As such, divinity is the same as feces,</p>
<p>The highest bhairava is obtained.</p>
<p>All those with kārā, are external.</p>
<p>All those with kārā destroyed, is supreme.</p>
<p>Hamsa, soham, all those mantras,</p>
<p>are worldly japa.</p>
<p>156</p>
<p>Those with deﬁnite number or shape or aspects of day and night,</p>
<p>[One shall abandon]. Treat one thousand the same as twenty.</p>
<p>The divine japa is particularized in this [nirvikalpa] voice.</p>
<p>Prāna inside, either easy or hard to attain, is a dumb idea.</p>
<p>157</p>
<p>This is indeed</p>
<p>the highest, extinct, greatest [dharma],</p>
<p>This shall neither enter nor manifest, at any time,</p>
<p>to those who are:</p>
<p>158</p>
<p>Vile, cruel,</p>
<p>Lacking devotion to their gurus.</p>
<p>[This teaching is for] those who have,</p>
<p>intelligence of nirvikalpa, or virtues (vīrā), or lofty nature.</p>
<p>159</p>
<p>If you are devoted to gurus and [people of same] class,</p>
<p>Abandon the trivial,</p>
<p>Village, kingdom, city, or any estates,</p>
<p>kids, wife, household.</p>
<p>160</p>
<p>[With] all those abandoned,</p>
<p>You shall understand:</p>
<p>How most unsteady,</p>
<p>To dwell on the seat of I&rsquo;ness, [regarded as] highest.</p>
<p>161</p>
<p>Even one proffers (pradāvyā) one&rsquo;s life [to God],</p>
<p>His highest eternality will not take.</p>
<p>Hear me well,</p>
<p>It is auspicious to offer I&rsquo;ness as the transcendental pleasing (paritṛpt).</p>
<p>162</p>
<p>On Rudrayāmala tantra,</p>
<p>Now the ﬁrst essence holds.</p>
<p>No śakti is separable with living beings.</p>
<p>The heart knowledge is cognition in the middle (jñatamadya).</p>
<p>163</p>
<p>Wherefore, in happy union, devī,</p>
<p>Gracefully, becomes the one with śiva.</p>
